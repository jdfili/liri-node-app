# liri-node-app

This is a CLI app. It is designed to take in three requests: 
- "spotify-this-song" + <song-name> 
- "movie-this" + <movie-name>
- "concert-this" + <artist-name>
Use any of these three requests to either look up a song in spotify, find info on a movie, or look up upcoming concerts for an artist.
